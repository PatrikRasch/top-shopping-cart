# Shopping Cart Project from The Odin Project

This project is a part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. The lesson can be found here:\ https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart

This project is live on GitHub Pages and can be found here:\ https://patrikrasch.github.io/top-shopping-cart/

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is twofold.\
First, the aim is to learn how to work with react-router-dom within React while building out a functional shopping cart app from scratch. The second goal is to learn how to work with testing within React.\
At this point in The Odin Project we've already extensively covered testing within vanilla JavaScript, and therefore we're adding to that knowledge by learning how to do testing in React.

## Features of this Completed Project

NB: This is not a real store.\
Users can check out the articles the page has on display and add them to cart, as well as "purchase" the items they've placed in their basket. The basket will then reset.\
There's also a contact page users can check out. This page contains a few links to some YouTube videos I either find amusing or that show a piece of my personality. There's also a link to my GitHub on this page.\

The webpage is plain and functionality is quite limited, this is on purpose.
